INTRODUCTION
	Hamiltonian for SC and Magnetism
	Pauli paramagnetism
		DOS
		enhanced DOS for sc (and inhomogeneous case?)
	RPA susceptibility
	homogeneous susceptibility derivation (BdG)
		limit for Del -> 0, T -> 0
	inhomogeneous susceptibility derivation (BdG)
CeCoIn5
	Experiments
		with field and orientations of field
		with pressure
		with doping
	Movement of fermi surface
		enhanced density of states
		number of introduced holes
HOMOGENEOUS ITINERANT (no M)
	ideal vectors
	enhancement results
	T-H phase diagram
	various Delta
	self consistent delta with magnetism???
HOMOGENEOUS TIGHT BINDING
	self consistent delta with magnetism (replicate kato T-H diagram for their Q)
	consider different Q's
	add J degree of freedom (T-H-J phase diagram)
HOMOGENEOUS CORNELL EXPERIMENTAL DISPERSION?

INHOMOGENEOUS SUSCEPTIBILITY??

CONCLUSIONS
	SC and Magnetism can and do coexist
	enhancement of DOS from SC plays key role
	Other directions
		localized magnetic moment interaction vs non local
		more inhomogeneous stuff
		3d calculations for CeCoIn5
