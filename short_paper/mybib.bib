  abstract={The properties of incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in the Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state are studied by solving the Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) equations. The relationship between the electronic structure and the magnetic structure is clarified. We find that the magnetic structure in the AFM-FFLO state includes three cases. (I) In the strongly localized case, the AFM staggered moment is confined into the FFLO nodal planes where the superconducting order parameter vanishes. (II) In the weakly localized case, the AFM staggered moment appears in the whole spatial region, and its magnitude is enhanced around the FFLO nodal planes. (III) In the extended case, the AFM staggered moment is nearly homogeneous and slightly suppressed in the vicinity of the FFLO nodal planes. The structure of Bragg peaks in the momentum resolved structure factor is studied in each case. We discuss the possibility of an AFM-FFLO state in the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn 5 by comparing these results with the neutron scattering data of CeCoIn 5 . Experimentally the magnetic structure and its dependence on the magnetic field orientation in the high-field superconducting phase of CeCoIn 5 are consistent with case (II).}

abstract ={Many superconducting materials allow the penetration of magnetic fields in a mixed state in which the superfluid is threaded by a regular lattice of Abrikosov vortices, each carrying one quantum of magnetic flux. The phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, based on the concept of characteristic length scales, has generally provided a good description of the Abrikosov vortex lattice state. We conducted neutron-scattering measurements of the vortex lattice form factor in the heavy-fermion superconductor cerium-cobalt-indium (CeCoIn5) and found that this form factor increases with increasing field—opposite to the expectations within the Abrikosov-Ginzburg-Landau paradigm. We propose that the anomalous field dependence of the form factor arises from Pauli paramagnetic effects around the vortex cores and from the proximity of the superconducting state to a quantum critical point.},

title = {Field-Induced Quantum Critical Point in CeCoIn5},
abstract = {The resistivity of the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 was measured as a function of temperature, down to 25mK and in magnetic fields of up to 16T applied perpendicular to the basal plane. With increasing field, we observe a suppression of the non-Fermi liquid behavior, ρ˜T, and the development of a Fermi liquid state, with its characteristic ρ=ρ0+AT2 dependence. The field dependence of the T2 coefficient shows critical behavior with an exponent of 1.37. This is evidence for a field-induced quantum critical point (QCP), occurring at a critical field which coincides, within experimental accuracy, with the superconducting critical field Hc2. We discuss the relation of this field-tuned QCP to a change in the magnetic state, seen as a change in magnetoresistance from positive to negative, at a crossover line that has a common border with the superconducting region below ˜1 K.},

abstract ={Strong magnetic fluctuations can provide a coupling mechanism for electrons that leads to unconventional superconductivity. Magnetic order and superconductivity have been found to coexist in a number of magnetically mediated superconductors, but these order parameters generally compete. We report that close to the upper critical field, CeCoIn5 adopts a multicomponent ground state that simultaneously carries cooperating magnetic and superconducting orders. Suppressing superconductivity in a first-order transition at the upper critical field leads to the simultaneous collapse of the magnetic order, showing that superconductivity is necessary for the magnetic order. A symmetry analysis of the coupling between the magnetic order and the superconducting gap function suggests a form of superconductivity that is associated with a nonvanishing momentum.},

title = {Coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism theoretical predictions and experimental results},
abstract = {Abstract Superconductivity and ferromagnetic ordering are two antagonistic types of ordering, and their mutual influence leads to many interesting phenomena which have been studied recently in ternary compounds. Theoretical analysis of ferromagnetic materials which are type II superconductors near the superconducting transition point T cl shows that they become type I near the magnetic transition point T M. The proposed theory constructed for the case T M « T cl predicts the formation of a transverse domain-like (DS phase) magnetic structure below T M. The electronic spectrum appears to be gapless in the DS phase of clean compounds with a re-entrant transition. The change from type II to type I behaviour as the sample is cooled to T M has been observed in ErRh4B4. Experimental data for HoMo6S8, HoMo6Se8 and ErRh4B4 give evidence for the coexistence of super-conductivity and non-uniform magnetic ordering below T M. Mutual influence of superconducting and magnetic orderings is also studied.},
