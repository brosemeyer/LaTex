Diffusive and ballistic systems are covered, both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. Thereby we demonstrate the common physical basis of various subtopics. },

  Abstract                 = {Many superconducting materials allow the penetration of magnetic fields in a mixed state in which the superfluid is threaded by a regular lattice of Abrikosov vortices, each carrying one quantum of magnetic flux. The phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, based on the concept of characteristic length scales, has generally provided a good description of the Abrikosov vortex lattice state. We conducted neutron-scattering measurements of the vortex lattice form factor in the heavy-fermion superconductor cerium-cobalt-indium (CeCoIn5) and found that this form factor increases with increasing field‚Äîopposite to the expectations within the Abrikosov-Ginzburg-Landau paradigm. We propose that the anomalous field dependence of the form factor arises from Pauli paramagnetic effects around the vortex cores and from the proximity of the superconducting state to a quantum critical point.},

To reproduce the observed inhomogeneity a random potential Vimp, within a Bogoliubov-deGennes (BdG) formalism, is considered. We perform calculations with fixed values of the disorder strength Vimp obtaining the distribution of Œî0(ri), and local density of charge carriers œÅ(ri), for different compounds of the LSCO family. The calculation of the relative root-mean-square deviation shows that the underdoped compounds are more inhomogeneous than the overdoped ones. Also, the spatial variation of Œî0(ri) decreases as the average density of charge carriers „ÄàœÅ„Äâ increases, demonstrating that the compounds are more homogeneous for high values of „ÄàœÅ„Äâ. The results indicate that the d-wave superconducting gaps seem to be more sensitive to a change in the disorder in comparison with the s-wave superconducting gaps.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors re-examine the technique of perturbed molecular dynamics as a method for calculating the autocorrelation function of the microscopic heat current and hence the thermal conductivity of a liquid. They show how the problem of taking the zero-wavevector limit, encountered by Ciccotti et al. (1979) may be overcome. They present calculations on the Lennard-Jones liquid which show that the perturbation technique gives an effective practical method of computing thermal conductivities.},

  Abstract                 = {The mutual influence of superconductivity and magnetism in F/S systems, i.e. systems of alternating ferromagnetic (F) and superconducting (S) layers, is comprehensively reviewed. For systems with ferromagnetic metal (FM) layers, a theory of the proximity effect in the dirty limit is constructed based on the Usadel equations. For an FM/S bilayer and an FM/S superlattice, a boundary-value problem involving finite FM/S boundary transparency and the diffusion and wave modes of quasi-particle motion is formulated; and the critical temperature T c is calculated as a function of FM- and S-layer thicknesses. A detailed analysis of a large amount of experimental data amply confirms the proposed theory. It is shown that the superconducting state of an FM/S system is a superposition of two pairing mechanisms, Bardin ‚Äì Cooper ‚Äì Schrieffer's in S layers and Larkin ‚Äì Ovchinnikov ‚Äì Fulde ‚Äì Ferrell's in FM ones. The competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spontaneous moment orientations in FM layers is explored for the 0- and œÄ-phase superconductivity in FM/S systems. For FI/S structures, where FI is a ferromagnetic insulator, a model for exchange interactions is proposed, which, along with direct exchange inside FI layers, includes indirect Ruderman ‚Äì Kittel ‚Äì Kasuya ‚Äì Yosida exchange between localized spins via S-layer conduction electrons. Within this framework, possible mutual accommodation scenarios for superconducting and magnetic order parameters are found, the corresponding phase diagrams are plotted, and experimental results are explained. The results of the theory of the Josephson effect for S/F/S junctions are presented and the application of the theory of spin-dependent transport to F/S/F junctions is discussed. Application aspects of the subject are examined.},

  Abstract                 = {Electric charge of a fermion that is coupled only to the gauge field of an abelian vortex need not be quantized, in contrast the situation for a magnetic monopole field. Correspondingly, zero-energy modes of the Dirac equation are not determined topologically. On the basis of mathematical and physical arguments we suggest that a complete description of the fermion-vortex system should include a fermion-scalar field interaction. This quantizes the charge and leads to a non-linear Dirac equation which possesses |n| zero-eigenvalue modes in the n-vortex background field. The result suggests that an index theorem exists for this Dirac equation on the non-compact space R2. When regularity requirements on the wave function are relaxed, additional normalizable zero-energy modes are present, even in the vacuum sector, n = 0, and fermions are converted to bosons.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies on high- T c superconductors have aroused new interest in tunnelling effects in unconventional superconductors. Unlike in conventional s-wave superconductors, the d-wave pairing state in these materials has an internal phase of the pair potential. The internal phase as a function of the wavevector of the Cooper pairs has a large influence on the electric properties of tunnelling junctions. Important effects of the internal phase on the Josephson current were first predicted theoretically. The idea has been established through several experiments using high- T c Josephson junctions, which detect œÄ-phase shift between the a - and b -axis directions and fractional flux quanta. These results give convincing evidence for d-wave symmetry in high- T c superconductors. In addition, the existence of new interference effects in the quasiparticle states near surfaces and boundaries has been suggested through theoretical predictions. Experimentally, a large number of tunnelling spectroscopy data showed zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs), the origin of which cannot be explained in terms of the classical concept that a tunnelling conductance spectrum is a phase-insensitive probe of the electronic states. It is clarified theoretically that the observed ZBCPs reflect the formation of zero-energy states on the surface due to the œÄ-phase shift of internal phase in the d-wave pairing symmetry. The formulation developed for tunnelling spectroscopy suggests that tunnelling spectroscopy is essentially phase sensitive. In addition, the formation of the bound states has been shown to have a serious influence on the electrical properties of Josephson junctions. Several anomalous properties including strong enhancement of the Josephson current in the low-temperature region have been predicted theoretically. In this report, recent developments in tunnelling effects on surface bound states in unconventional superconductors are reviewed.},

  Abstract                 = {Strong magnetic fluctuations can provide a coupling mechanism for electrons that leads to unconventional superconductivity. Magnetic order and superconductivity have been found to coexist in a number of magnetically mediated superconductors, but these order parameters generally compete. We report that close to the upper critical field, CeCoIn5 adopts a multicomponent ground state that simultaneously carries cooperating magnetic and superconducting orders. Suppressing superconductivity in a first-order transition at the upper critical field leads to the simultaneous collapse of the magnetic order, showing that superconductivity is necessary for the magnetic order. A symmetry analysis of the coupling between the magnetic order and the superconducting gap function suggests a form of superconductivity that is associated with a nonvanishing momentum.},

The experimental results on 7Li, 27Al and 63Cu are discussed with special reference to the influence of the correlation between the electrons. The deviations from the 1/T law for Li are all or nearly all attributed to the influence of paramagnetic impurities. },

  Abstract                 = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this review, we summarize the present status of theories of the spin fluctuation (SF) mechanism in explaining anomalous or non-Fermi liquid behaviours and unconventional superconductivity (SC) in strongly correlated electron systems around the antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum critical point. We refer to the high- T c cuprates, two-dimensional organic compounds and heavy electron systems. We argue that the SF theories are successful in explaining at least the essential part of the problems, indicating that AF SF is the common origin of SC in these systems. This review is concluded by several comments on remaining problems which may require some additions to the SF theory, like the pseudo-gap phenomena observed in the hole-underdoped cuprates.},

  Abstract                 = {A general formulation is given to the quantum theory of steady diffusion. In seeking for a steady solution of Liouville's equation, the boundary condition is taken into account by requiring that the solution should lead to a given distribution of average density. The distribution is to be determined by macroscopic law of diffusion and macroscopic boundary condition.The basic equation thus obtained has a form similar to Bloch's kinetic equation and reduces to the latter in the limit of a system of weakly interacting particles. This is shown by generalizing a demping theoretical expansion of Kohn and Luttinger.It is found that the Einstein relation is valid only for the symmetric part of diffusion- and electric conductivity tensors, in agreement with Kasuya's suggestion.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We present a technique to map an electronic model with local interactions (a generalized multi-orbital Hubbard model) onto an effective model of interacting classical spins, by requiring that the thermodynamic potentials associated to spin rotations in the two systems are equivalent up to second order in the rotation angles, when the electronic system is in a symmetry-broken phase. This allows to determine the parameters of relativistic and non-relativistic magnetic interactions in the effective spin model in terms of equilibrium Green‚Äôs functions of the electronic model. The Hamiltonian of the electronic system includes, in addition to the non-relativistic part, relativistic single-particle terms such as the Zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field, spin‚Äìorbit coupling, and arbitrary magnetic anisotropies; the orbital degrees of freedom of the electrons are explicitly taken into account. We determine the complete relativistic exchange tensors, accounting for anisotropic exchange, Dzyaloshinskii‚ÄìMoriya interactions, as well as additional non-diagonal symmetric terms (which may include dipole‚Äìdipole interaction). The expressions of all these magnetic interactions are determined in a unified framework, including previously disregarded features such as the vertices of two-particle Green‚Äôs functions and non-local self-energies. We do not assume any smallness in spin‚Äìorbit coupling, so our treatment is in this sense exact. Finally, we show how to distinguish and address separately the spin, orbital and spin‚Äìorbital contributions to magnetism, providing expressions that can be computed within a tight-binding Dynamical Mean Field Theory. },

For a singly quantized vortex, I present complete analytical solutions in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials in the opposite limits of vanishing and large vortex core size. There is an infinite number of such bound states, with a spectrum that is, when squared, given by, respectively, the Coulomb potential and the isotropic harmonic oscillator. Possible experimental signatures of this spectrum in condensed-matter realizations of the system are pointed out. },

  Abstract                 = {The dx2‚àíy2-wave symmetry of the order parameter leads to various physical phenomena of high-temperature superconductors which are not present in standard superconductors. A particularly interesting new aspect occurs in connection with the behavior of the order parameter in the vicinity of interfaces (Josephson junctions) between superconductors and close to surfaces. In this review we discuss the appearance of localized states with broken time-reversal symmetry in these regions, using various different schemes of analysis: the tunneling formalism, the Bogolyubov-de Gennes equation, and the generalized Ginzburg-Landau theory. We demonstrate that this kind of state is connected with the opening of a gap in the quasiparticle density of states which lowers the local free energy density. A direct consequence of time-reversal symmetry breaking can be seen in the presence of spontaneous supercurrents. Other features, such as the possibility of vortices with fractional flux quanta and unusual phase slip effects in Josephson junctions are examined as possible experimental indications for a time-reversal symmetry breaking state. Furthermore, quasiparticle tunneling has been recently discussed and applied to probe the surface of such a superconductor for the violation of time-reversal symmetry. Concerning the magnetic properties surfaces supporting such a state can yield a paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic response of the superconductor. Finally, some examples of superconductors which break time-reversal symmetry in the bulk are discussed. Clear signals in the zero-field relaxation rate of muons leave little doubt that such superconducting states are realized in UPt3, U1‚àíxThxBe13 and Sr2RuO4.},

  Abstract                 = { On the basis of the Bogoliubov‚Äìde Gennes theory for the two-dimensional extended Hubbard model, the vortex structure in d -wave superconductors is investigated including the contribution of the induced incommensurate antiferromagnetism around the vortex core. As the on-site repulsive interaction U increases, the spatial structure of charge and spin changes from the antiferromagnetic state with checkerboard modulation to that with the stripe modulation. By the effect of the induced antiferromagnetic moment, the zero-energy density of states is suppressed, and the vortex core radius increases. We also study the effect of the local density of states (LDOS) change on the site-dependent nuclear relaxation rate $T1^{-1}(r)$. These results are compared with a variety of experiments performed on high T c cuprates.

  Abstract                 = {Superfluid 3 He is an intensively investigated and well characterized p-wave superfluid. In the bulk Balian‚ÄìWerthamer state, which is commonly called the 3 He B phase, the superfluid gap is opened isotropically but near a flat boundary such as a wall of a container it can harbor interesting quasi-particle states inside the gap. These states are called surface Andreev bound states, and have not been experimentally explored in detail. Transverse acoustic impedance measurement has revealed their existence and provided spectroscopic details of the dispersion of the bound states. Recent theoretical arguments claim that the surface Andreev bound states of the superfluid 3 He B phase can be recognized as the edge states of the topological superfluid and be regarded as a Majorana fermion, a fancy particle which has not been confirmed in elementary particle physics. In this review, we present up-to-date knowledge on the surface Andreev bound states of the 3 He B phase revealed by acoustic spectroscopy and the possible realization of a Majorana fermion, along with related studies on this topic.},

  Abstract                 = {The properties of incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in the Fulde‚ÄìFerrell‚ÄìLarkin‚ÄìOvchinnikov (FFLO) state are studied by solving the Bogoliubov‚Äìde Gennes (BdG) equations. The relationship between the electronic structure and the magnetic structure is clarified. We find that the magnetic structure in the AFM-FFLO state includes three cases. (I) In the strongly localized case, the AFM staggered moment is confined into the FFLO nodal planes where the superconducting order parameter vanishes. (II) In the weakly localized case, the AFM staggered moment appears in the whole spatial region, and its magnitude is enhanced around the FFLO nodal planes. (III) In the extended case, the AFM staggered moment is nearly homogeneous and slightly suppressed in the vicinity of the FFLO nodal planes. The structure of Bragg peaks in the momentum resolved structure factor is studied in each case. We discuss the possibility of an AFM-FFLO state in the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn 5 by comparing these results with the neutron scattering data of CeCoIn 5 . Experimentally the magnetic structure and its dependence on the magnetic field orientation in the high-field superconducting phase of CeCoIn 5 are consistent with case (II).},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the antiferromagnetic (AF) order in the d -wave superconducting (SC) state at high magnetic fields. A two-dimensional model with on-site repulsion U , inter-site attractive interaction V and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction J is solved using mean field theory. For finite values of U and J , a first order transition occurs from the normal state to the FFLO state, while the FFLO-BCS phase transition is second order, consistent with the experimental results in CeCoIn 5 . Although the BCS-FFLO transition is continuous, the Ne√©l temperature of AF order is discontinuous at the phase boundary because the AF order in the FFLO state is induced by the Andreev bound state localized in the zeros of FFLO order parameter, while the AF order hardly occurs in the uniform BCS state. The spatial structure of the magnetic moment is investigated for the commensurate AF state as well as for the incommensurate AF state. The influence of the spin fluctuations is discussed for both states. Since the fluctuations are enhanced in the normal state for incommensurate AF order, this AF order can be confined in the FFLO state. The experimental results in CeCoIn 5 are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {An intriguing aspect of unconventional superconductivity is that it always appears in the vicinity of other competing phases, whose suppression brings the full emergence of superconductivity. In the iron pnictides, these competing phases are marked by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition and a collinear spin-density wave (SDW) transition. There has been macroscopic evidence for competition between these phases and superconductivity as the magnitude of both the orthorhombicity and magnetic moment are suppressed in the superconducting state. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on detwinned underdoped Ba1‚àíxKxFe2As2, we observe a coexistence of both the SDW gap and superconducting gap in the same electronic structure. Furthermore, our data reveal that following the onset of superconductivity, the SDW gap decreases in magnitude and shifts in a direction consistent with a reduction of the orbital anisotropy. This observation provides direct spectroscopic evidence for the dynamic competition between superconductivity and both SDW and electronic nematic orders in these materials.},

This symmetry enables the construction of a SO(5) quantum nonlinear œÉ model that describes the phase diagram and the effective low-energy dynamics of the system. This model naturally explains the basic phenomenology of the high-Tc superconductors from the insulating to the underdoped and the optimally doped region.},
