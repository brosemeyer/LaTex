	 {\large We calculate the wave-vector dependent electronic spin susceptibility 
	$\chi_{\alpha\beta}(\vq, \vH_0)$ 
	of a superconducting state in uniform magnetic field $\vH_0$. 
	We consider Pauli limited materials with $d$-wave symmetry, and a 2D cylindrical 
	electronic Fermi surface.  
	We find that both longitudinal and transverse components of the susceptibility tensor are enhanced over their
	normal state values in the high-field low-temperature region of the $H-T$
	phase diagram. We identify several wave vectors, connecting field-produced hot spots on the Fermi surface, 
	that correspond to the enhancement of either $\chi_\perp$ or $\chi_\parallel$ components. }

    		\begin{block}{\centering\Huge Motivation}
Possibly the two most widely studied orders that often appear together are superconductivity and magnetism. Both these orders are strongly tied to the behavior of the quantum mechanical spin. Ferromagnetic order and singlet superconductivity avoid each other becuase they have opposite spin structure, while triplet superconductors are much less sensitive to ferromagnetism. In contrast, antiferromagnetic order with spatial period much smaller than the coherence length does not interfere with the superconducting order and thus the two orders often appear together. \\
