Hydrogen Dominant Metallic Alloys: High Temperature Superconductors? \\

"No experimental studies of hydrogen sulphide are known above 100 GPa" \\
\quad Drozdov et al, Nature 2015 \\ [0.5cm]
"Metallization and superconductivity in sulfur hydride occur at such
high pressure when nothing is known in advance regarding the basic physical properties of the material
under study. Not even the chemical formula is known and it is for theory to establish, in the first place,
the very composition of the compound under investigation at such pressure." \\
